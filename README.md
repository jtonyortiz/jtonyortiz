## :small_blue_diamond: Introduction
Hello everyone, my name is James, I am a Computer Science graduate from Florida State University (FSU). I enjoy learning about new technologies and recent developments in software as well as improving on important software development concepts. I consider myself a generalist of computer languages (mainly C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript). 

Domains I have worked in:
- Data Engineering (Formerly)
- Distributed Systems (Formerly)
- Systems Programming (Current)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development (Current)
- Operating Systems (OS) Development (Current)


## :small_blue_diamond: Experience
My curiosity with software development started out in grade school. As a pragmatic learner, I began picking up ANSI C development by my own interest and later began using the WIN32 API for Windows applications. Eventually I got bored of Windows ME and I was then introduced to Ubuntu Linux at a local LUG (Linux User Group) gathering at a local library in 2005. I started out by building a few small console apps such as a tetris game, and a calculator. My access to the internet was scarce as I still did not have internet from home, so I learned on my own by borrowing books from a public library along with using the compilers and man pages provided by the Linux OS itself. Now, being a graduate in this field, my understanding of Software Development has changed dramatically ever since I have began to study Computer Science from an academic perspective, and not just seeing programming as a daily hobby, ultimately preparing me for work in industry.

### :small_blue_diamond: SWE I Capstone Project: Real-Time Vehicle Identifier for Bicycles (Machine Learning)
During Fall 2019, I completed a 4-month long software development project that my team (ByteMyAscii) created. Essentially, the project consisted on building an embedded machine-learning program that could be mounted on a bicycle that could provide the cyclist the ability to have a 3rd eye on the road and be able to note an incoming/oncoming vechicle without turning around. To achieve this goal, my team used a Raspberry-pi, a computer with Linux, an NVIDIA Graphics Card, multiple machine learning and image processing libraries, as well as a general understanding of Python. Despite encountering some diffculties with the constraints and limitations that the Raspberry-Pi had, the project was a success in both theory and practice, and was completed entirely remotely through daily online scrum mettings as well as by applying modern Agile development strategies.
