### James Ortiz :computer:

## :small_blue_diamond: Introduction:
Hello everyone, my name is James, I am a Computer Science graduate from Florida State University (FSU). I love to learn about new technologies and recent developments in software as well as improving on important development concepts. I consider myself a generalist among a lot of computer languages (like C++, Java, JavaSctpt, TypeScript, and Python), but I focus most of my attention on C/C++ and Python. While my focus is on **Systems Programming and Artificial Intelligence**, I am also familiar with creating Web / Desktop Applications, and Data Science.

## :small_blue_diamond: Experience:
My curiosity with software development started out in grade school. As a pragmatic learner, I began picking up ANSI C development by my own interest and later began using the WIN32 API for Windows applications. Eventually I got bored of Windows ME and I was then introduced to Ubuntu Linux very early on in 2005. I started out by building a few small console apps such as a tetris game, and a calculator. My access to the internet was scarce as I did not have internet from home, so I learned on my own by borrowing books from a public library along with the compilers and man pages provided by the Linux OS. My understanding of Software Development has changed dramatically ever since I have began to study Computer Science from an academic perspective, and not just seeing programming as a daily hobby. While in college and university, I applied a lot of CS knowledge and concepts Computer Architecture, Operating Systems Development using Redhat, Debian & Ubuntu Linux, Databases, RESTful Services, Data Science, Advanced Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Algorithmic Complexity. 

### :small_blue_diamond: SWE I Capstone Project: Real-Time Vehicle Identifier for Bicycles (Machine Learning)
During Fall 2019, I completed a 4-month long software development project that my team (ByteMyAscii) created. Essentially, the project consisted on building an embedded machine learning program that could be mounted on a bicycle that could provide the cyclist the ability to have a 3rd eye on the road and be able to note an incoming/oncoming vechicle without turning around. To achieve this goal, my team used a Raspberry-pi, a computer with Linux and an NVIDIA Graphics Card, multiple machine learning and image processing libraries, as well as a general understanding of Python. Despite encountering some diffculties with the constraints and limitations that the Raspberry-Pi had, the project was a success in both theory and practice, and was completed entirely remotely through daily online srum mettings as well as applying modern Agile development strategies.
