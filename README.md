### Hello There and WELCOME to James's GitHub Page! ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction:
Hello everyone, my name is James, I am currently an undergrad Computer Science student at Florida State University (FSU). I love to learn about new technolgies and recent developments in software as well as improving on important development concepts. A lot of my software development skills hover around programming languages such as C/C++ for Systems Development, C# and the .Net Framework for Web Applications, and finally, Kotlin and Java for Mobile Development. Please feel free to look at my repos to get a glimpse of the projects iv'e worked on my own and also in academia.

## Experience:
My curiosity with software development started out in grade school. As a pragmatic learner, I began picking up ANSI C development by my own interest and later began using the WIN32 API for Windows applications. I built a few small console apps such as a tetris game, and a calculator. I also began learning how to create static webpages using HTML/CSS. My understanding of Software Development has changed dramatically ever since. While in college and university, I applied a lot of CS knowledge around Computer Architecture, Operating Systems Development using Redhat & Ubuntu Linux, Database Theory, RESTful Services, Data Science, Data Structures, Software Engineering, and Algorithmic Complexity. 

## SWE II Capstone Project: Real-Time Vehicle Identifier for Bicycles (Machine Learning)
During Fall 2019, I completed a 4-month long software development project that my team (ByteMyAscii) created. Essentially, the project consisted on building a machine learning program that could be mounted on a bicycle that could provide the cyclist the ability to have a 3rd eye on the road and be able to note an incoming/oncoming vechicle without turning around. To achieve this goal, my team used a Raspberry-pi, a computer with Linux and an NVIDIA Graphics Card, multiple machine learning and image processing libraries, as well as a general understanding of Python. Despite having some diffculties with the constraints and limitations that the Raspberry-Pi had, the project was a success, and was completely developed remotely through daily srum mettings and applying Agile development strategies.
